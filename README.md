# SynaptomeMapping-Knockouts
Bayesian analysis of synaptome mapping data, sharing information across regions

Formatting of data:

Data should be formatted as shown in Data/*

Names of brainregions must have an underscore between the major region and the subregion, i.e. CorticalSubplate_BLAa. 
That is because all the data from the region is used to constrain parameters for the subregion.
